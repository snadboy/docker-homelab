# n8n Environment Variables
# Copy to .env and customize as needed
#
# NOTE: Workflow-specific constants (API keys, service URLs, tokens) are stored
# in the "Homelab Constants" credential via the n8n-nodes-globals community node.
# Edit them in the n8n UI under Settings > Credentials > Homelab Constants.
# The .env file only needs n8n system variables (if any custom ones are needed).
