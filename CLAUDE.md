## Deployment

Stacks are managed by **Dockhand** (hawser agents on each host). Push to git → Dockhand detects → deploys automatically.

| Host | Dockhand Env ID | Key Stacks |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| utilities | 9 (was ansible-controller before migration) | semaphore, uptime-kuma, dockhand, gotify, homepage |
| arr | — | sonarr, radarr, prowlarr, overseerr, tautulli, agregarr, tracearr |
| fetch | — | sabnzbd |
| bedrock | — | pulse, pwa-appserver, windmill |
| cadre | — | traefik + traefik-http-provider, zigbee2mqtt (×3) |
| plex | — | plex |

## Key Stack Notes

**semaphore** (`semaphore/docker-compose.yml`)
- Port 3002 on utilities (3000 taken by Dockhand)
- `SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `SEMAPHORE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`
- Traefik label: `snadboy.revp.3002.domain=semaphore.isnadboy.com`

**traefik-http-provider** (`traefik-http-provider/docker-compose.yml`)
- `dns_search: ["tail65635.ts.net"]` required — container can't resolve Tailscale short hostnames without it
- Volume: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/traefik-http-provider-config/_data/` on cadre
- `devs` disabled in `ssh-hosts.yaml`

**plex** (`plex/docker-compose.yml`)
- Migrated from multivac VM 110 to colossus LXC 107 on 2026-04-10 (multivac was crash-looping due to suspected Intel Raptor Lake Vmin Shift Instability)
- `mem_limit: 12g`
- Hardware transcoding via `/dev/dri` bind-mount (LXC, not VM-level VFIO). Uses colossus's Meteor Lake Intel Arc iGPU. Verified 8 simultaneous transcodes.
- Earlier GPU-passthrough attempt on multivac VM was reverted because VFIO caused hard host lockups; the LXC bind-mount path is fundamentally different and stable.
